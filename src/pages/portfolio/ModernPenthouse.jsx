        The Modern Penthouse is a modern and eclectic project that was designed to reflect the spirit and personality of the Client.
        <br/>
        The project, located at the last two top floors of an old soviet building near the House of Parliament in Kiev, is internally developed in three different working levels.
        <br/>
        Straight modern lines, and black-white contrast colors, was the dominant theme chosen.
      </p>
      <p className="main-text">
        The total area of 760 m2 took into account some specific design and engineering solutions that pushed further the limits of both our engineers and the building itself.
        <br/>
        In fact a swimming pool was planned to be realized in the middle of the living room â€“ 27 m3 of water with a fully glass facade.
        <br/>
        The challenge given in order to realize a swimming pool on the last floor of an old soviet building was one-of-a-kind, and yet very stimulating and interesting for us.
      </p>
      <p className="main-text">
        Our engineering Italian office provided then a complete proposal, a full set of shop drawings for approval by local authorities, in order to start the works.
        <br/>
        Calculations made by our staff, included the study of the building structure: we searched in local Kiev architectural archives for the old project of how the fundaments of the building were realized during USSR era.
        <br/>
        Also we made a full brand new calculation on the water weights and stress-test on the glass walls, another challenge inside the challenge.

      <p className="main-text">
        Another important individual project and very interesting challenge, was the full design and realization of a motorized round table, diam. 2300mm.
        <br/>
        This round table was required to reach from normal table dining level (+750mm from floor level) up to a maximum height of +2200mm.
        <br/>
        Total weight of the glass and structure to be raised was almost 400 kgs.
      </p>
      <p className="main-text">
        Not only: the central part of the table (diam. 1400mm) was supposed to be rotating. The external part (diam. 2300mm) was fixed.
        <br/>
        The biggest challenge here faced by our engineers, was the fact to design a safe table, that could raise in safety, and considering it was a dining table, that no bottles, or glasses were falling off during the process.
        <br/>
        Our engineers provided again a fully working and wonderful table that passed all possible tests, and that was finally connected to the Smart-Home system in order to activate the movement from the phone or ipad.
      </p>
      <p className="main-text">
        All furniture that can be seen in the various renders was all individually designed by our Studio, and then realized in accordance with the shop-drawings that were made by us.
        <br/>
        Even sofas and armchairs were individually designed and a specific executive drawing was prepared for each one of them. Almost nothing was ordered by catalogue.
